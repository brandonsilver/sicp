About
==========

This is the code I'm writing to go along with "Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs" by Abelson et al. Some is from the book and some is my own work (my code will be
labeled as such).

Getting SICP
------------

You can find SICP all over the web (as it is freely distributed). There's a neat project on
GitHub aiming to re-typeset the entire book in LaTeX:
[https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf]().
